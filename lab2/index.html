					<h2>♡Challenge♡</h2>
					<p>The main challenge of lab 2 was navigating and understanding how to use CSS. I found this to be the most difficult aspect of the lab because I did not know how to design the basic structures of the webpage. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>♡Problems♡</h2>
					<p>The most difficult problem for me was creating classes. I was very confused on how classes worked and I did not understand how to utilze them in order to create designs on css. Luckily with the aid of my partner and with my TA I was able to grasp a better understanding of classes and use them in my HTML Format</p>

					<h2>♡Reflection♡</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? I think that creating the assignment was a bit rocky at first because this was my first time working with HTML and with CSS. But after learning a bit more on the structures, classes, and HTML tags, I started to get the hang of it!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>♡Results♡</h2>
					<p>Overall I am proud of what I was able to create for this assignment! I was able to learn so much on HTML formats and CSS. I feel a bit more comfortable working with both formats and I think I could be able to create my own webpage.</p>
