					<h2>♡ Challenge ♡</h2>
					<p> I think that the main challenge of this lab was making sure to read thoroughly what the professor was asking for in the assignment to make sure I was following the guidelines and to make sure I did not miss any subtask in the rules.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>♡ Problems ♡</h2>
					<p> I think the problems that I had for this lab was memorization. I did make a couple of errors when typing the code. I think that I just need to get used to working with the code and the variables that I already know.</p>
