					<h2>♡Challenge♡</h2>
					<p> I think that the main challenge of this lab was making sure to pay attention to small details that were written for the assignment. I made sure to reread a couple of the tasks in the lab to make sure nothing went overlooked.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>♡Problems♡</h2>
					<p> I think the problems that I had for this lab was memorization. I did make a couple of errors when typing the code. I think that I just need to get used to working with the code and the variables that I already know.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>♡Reflection♡</h2>
					<p>Overall I will say that while the task was a bit overwhelming at first, it became easier as soon as I fully understood each task and what I had to complete for the assignment. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>♡Results♡</h2>
					<p>I am proud that I am slowly but surely getting a better understanding of working with HTML and CSS. I wish there was more time to work on designing webpages but I am excited to see what other projects my Professor has in store for the class.</p>
