					<h2>☆ Challenge ☆</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this weeks lab was to create a function and an anonymous function that can be called in the console log.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>☆ Problems ☆</h2>
					<p>The main problem I had was calling the anonymous function into my code. I kept recieving errors in my console and I did not understand what I was doing wrong. Luckily with the help of my partner and another group of friends we were able to solve the problem by making the anonymous function a variable so that it could be called.</p>
