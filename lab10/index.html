					<h2>♡ Problems ♡</h2>
					<p>I think the main problem that I ran into when doing this assignment was understanding the tasks. I kept getting confused on why my code was not functioning. It was not until I reread the tasks that had to be completed that I realized the mistakes in my JavaScript code. From there I was able to get my code to work!</p>
