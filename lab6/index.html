					<h2>☆ Challenge ☆</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this weeks lab was to focus on how to create arrays and objects in order to to print them onto an html webpage designed by a css styesheet.</p>

					<h2>☆ Problems ☆</h2>
					<p>I think the main problem for me again was javaScript. I think learning about objects and arrays was a bit difficult for me because of the specfic types of brackets that need to be implemented for certain parts of the program to function and run. I was able to conquer a bit of the problems I had with javaScript by going on W3Schools and relearning about concepts taught in class.</p>
