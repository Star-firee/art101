					<h2>♡ Problems ♡</h2>
					<p>The overall challenging part of this project was making sure my javascript was working correctly. My code wasn't running for the first couple times, so I had to go back to my javascript file to make sure every piece of code that I typed wasn't an error. Luckily I was able to solve the problem by fixing an error that led to my code functioning properly.</p>
