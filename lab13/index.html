				<h2>♡ Challenge ♡</h2>
				<p>The challenge for this lab was to create a loop. </p>

				<h2>♡ Problems ♡</h2>
				<p>I struggled with calling back the loop for the output. I realized it was much easier to simply delete the function and just create a loop so that it could be called in the html output. I also stuggled with wrapping the string of my javaScript output. With the help of professor's code from his lab assignment I was able to figure out what I needed to put in my css code in order to get the string to display in broken text. </p>
